    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I adapted a pumpkin muffin recipe to come up with this delectable sweet potato concoction that is a true muffin, and not a cake! I think the sweet potato lends even more flavor than pumpkin. Added bonus: this recipe just happens to be dairy free, a plus for those who are intolerant to dairy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked, mashed sweet potato</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten
        </li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pecans
        </li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, sweet potato, olive oil, water, and eggs in a bowl. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a second bowl. Add flour mixture and pecans to the sweet potato mixture. Fold gently until just moistened, being careful not to overmix. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Do not overbake. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
